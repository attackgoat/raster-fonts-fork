This crate provides a command line utility for rasterizing true type fonts into bitmaps,
both traditional and signed distance fields. It also provides a tiny library for deserializing
the metadata required for dynamic text layout calculations; both [`serde`][serde] and
[`rkyv`][rkyv] are supported here.

## The `font2img` CLI

### Installation Using `cargo`

```
> cargo install raster-fonts
```

### Basic Usage

```
> font2img <InputFontFile> <OutputImagePath> <OutputMetadataPath>
```

This will generate a monochrome signed distance field texture containing all glyphs in the printable
ASCII range from the given font file. [As described by Chris Green, then working for Valve](valve-paper):

> In the simplest case, this texture can then be rendered simply by using the alpha-testing and
> alpha-thresholding feature of modern GPUs, without a custom shader. [...]
> 
> With the use of programmable shading, the technique is extended to perform various special effect
> renderings, including soft edges, outlining, drop shadows, multi-colored images, and sharp corners.

For a short video demonstration of this technique, see [this video by Martin Donald][mdonald-demo].

**Supported output image formats** include PNG, BMP, TIFF, TGA. The **supported metadata formats**
are [RON][ron], [JSON][json], and [RKYV][rkyv]. Note that kerning information cannot be exported to
JSON, because JSON dictionaries must be indexed by strings, whereas the other formats support indexing
by pairs of characters.

### Specifying Custom Character Ranges

```
> font2img <Font> <Img> <Meta> [Charset]...
```

To rasterize a different set of glyphs, one or more Unicode codepoint ranges must be specified after the
input/output paths. Codepoints are given in hexadecimal, without any prefix, and may stand alone.
Alternatively, a contiguous range may be specified by the inclusive minimum and maximum. For example:

```
# This is equivalent to the basic invocation from the previous section:
> font2img <Font> <Img> <Meta> 20-7F

# Additioanlly rasterize printable characters from the Latin-1 Supplement:
> font2img <Font> <Img> <Meta> 20-7F A1-FF

# Throw in the Pilcrow sign (Â¶) only:
> font2img <Font> <Img> <Meta> 20-7F B1
```

### Generating Conventional Bitmap Fonts

If you do not wish to use signed distance fields for whatever reason, you can switch to conventional
glyph rendering with the `--coverage-levels <N>` option (`-l <N>` for short), where `<N>` is the number
of distinct grayscale values greater than 0 you want in the output image. Regardless of the number of
levels, the output image will be a monochrome 8bpp image, with the highest level set to 255.

```
# Rasterize with maximum fidelity:
> font2img -l 255 <Font> <Img> <Meta>

# Generate a binary image, i.e. rasterize without anti-aliasing:
> font2img -l 1 <Font> <Img> <Meta>

# Use a happy medium with 16 total distinct values:
> font2img -l 15 <Font> <Img> <Meta>
```

This is still useful, especially if you know the exact text size you need, and want to manually process
the texture after generating it with this tool.

### Full Help Output

```
> font2img --help
Bitmap font creation tool and accompanying metadata deserialization library

```

## The `raster_fonts` Library

This is a single-module library of just a few plain-old data types that implement various de-/serialization
traits, depending on the cargo features you set. As such, you'll want to use different features depending on
the data format of your choice. So if you prefer `rkyv`, put this into your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
raster-fonts = { version = "0.1", features = ["rkyv-deserialize"] }
rkyv = "0.7"
```

If you want to use `serde`, you'll also need either `serde_json` or the `ron` crate:

```toml
[dependencies]
raster-fonts = { version = "0.1", features = ["serde-deserialize"] }
# depending on data format:
serde_json = "1"
ron = "0.8"
```
